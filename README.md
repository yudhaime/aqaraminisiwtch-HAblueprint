# Home Assistant Blueprint: Multi-Press Button Actions

This blueprint allows you to assign different actions to a **single button** entity, based on the type of press:
- **Single press**
- **Double press**
- **Long press**

It is especially useful for button devices that report the type of press in their `event_type` attribute (e.g., Zigbee buttons, Matter buttons, etc.).
